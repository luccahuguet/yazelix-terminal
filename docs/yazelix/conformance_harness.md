# Conformance Harness

The local harness lives at `tools/yazelix_conformance.py`. It is intentionally
small and dependency-free so protocol research can move without changing Rio's
Rust workspace.

## Commands

List checked-in fixture streams:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py list
```

Validate fixture manifest bytes and the Ghostty cursor shader probe:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py verify
```

Emit one fixture byte stream to a terminal or file:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py emit osc133_semantic_prompt
```

Record local source/version evidence:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py record-env
```

Launch the built Rio binary with CPU renderer and capture a COSMIC screenshot:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py launch-cpu-screenshot
```

Launch the built WGPU Rio binary with the Ghostty cursor shader probe and
capture a COSMIC screenshot:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py launch-wgpu-shader-screenshot
```

Pass `--shader` more than once to validate a Ghostty-style shader chain:

```text
python3 tools/yazelix_conformance.py launch-wgpu-shader-screenshot \
  --shader /path/to/cursor_trail_dusk.glsl \
  --shader /path/to/generated_effects/sweep.glsl \
  --shader /path/to/generated_effects/rectangle_boom.glsl
```

The WGPU renderer probe config lives at
`artifacts/shader_probe/rio_wgpu_config/config.toml`. It sets the WGPU backend
and loads the checked-in Ghostty cursor probe:

```toml
[renderer]
backend = "Webgpu"
custom-shader = ["conformance/shaders/ghostty_cursor_probe.glsl"]
```

Use it when validating shader work so failures clearly belong to WGPU or the
host graphics stack, not to Rio's default native Vulkan backend. On a working
GPU stack, that probe should compile through Naga's GLSL frontend and tint the
cursor area from `iCurrentCursor`.

The default screenshot command uses `WGPU_BACKEND=gl` because the local COSMIC
Wayland/NVIDIA stack can create a WGPU/GL surface while WGPU/Vulkan currently
fails surface creation. That is a validation recipe, not a renderer contract:
Vulkan still needs separate fixing before it can be treated as the default WGPU
backend for this host.

## Current Fixture Scope

The first manifest covers:

- OSC 8 hyperlinks
- OSC 52 clipboard query
- Kitty OSC 21 keyed color control
- Kitty OSC 22 pointer shapes
- OSC 133 semantic prompt regions
- Kitty OSC 66 text sizing
- Kitty OSC 99 desktop notification
- Kitty keyboard mode query
- Kitty keyboard all-flags query
- Kitty keyboard stack push/union/pop/query stream
- Kitty graphics 1x1 RGBA transmit/place
- minimal Sixel DCS path
- synchronized output DECSET 2026
- XTVERSION
- XTGETTCAP RGB query

The fixtures are not proof that Rio supports every protocol correctly. They are
stable byte streams that future beads can feed into Rio, Ghostty, WezTerm, or
black-box probes and compare against expected behavior.

## Shader Probe

`conformance/shaders/ghostty_cursor_probe.glsl` is a minimal shader that reads
Ghostty's cursor uniforms. It is not a visual parity target by itself. Its job is
to fail early when a renderer path cannot compile or populate the names Yazelix
cursor presets depend on.

CPU renderer screenshots prove process launch and window rendering only. They do
not prove shader parity.
