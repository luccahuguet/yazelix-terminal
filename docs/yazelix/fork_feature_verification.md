# Yazelix Terminal Fork-Owned Feature Verification

Status: fork-owned additions are tracked by row with focused verification
evidence.

This file is only for behavior, tooling, policy, or documentation that the
`yazelix-terminal` fork adds on top of the Rio base commit
`7e18dde1c90182a5170a7cca7779544967d7291c`.

If a row describes inherited Rio behavior, unchanged terminal behavior, a
baseline launch check, a benchmark run, a source audit, or a deferred feature,
it does not belong here. Put it in
`docs/yazelix/validated_not_added.md` instead.

## Classification Rule

Rows in this file are fork-owned additions. They may be one of:

- `runtime`: user-visible terminal behavior added by the fork
- `tooling`: conformance, benchmark, screenshot, packaging, or smoke-test tooling
- `policy`: documented security, source-use, or support boundary owned by the fork
- `docs`: durable documentation authored by the fork

Rows in this file must not be described as merely "verified". Verification
evidence belongs in the right column, but the middle column must name the
fork-owned addition. Each row also records the practical implication today and
the future possibility the addition opens, so the ledger stays useful for
prioritization instead of becoming only a completion checklist.

## Common Gates

These checks were used repeatedly as the fork-wide regression floor:

```bash
nix develop -c cargo fmt --check
nix develop -c cargo check -p rioterm
nix develop -c cargo build -p rioterm
nix develop -c cargo build -p rioterm --features wgpu
nix run .#yazelix-protocol-conformance -- verify
git diff --check
```

The current focused package checks also include:

```bash
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo check -p rioterm --no-default-features --features wgpu,x11,wayland
cargo test -p rio-window
cargo test --features wgpu ghostty -- --nocapture
nix build .#yazelix-terminal-fast
tools/yazelix_event_mode_smoke.sh ./result_yazelix_terminal_fast_package
```

The X11 IME callback cast warning is fixed in `0880df924a`; the focused
`rioterm` check above is warning-free.

| tooling | Conformance harness | Adds checked-in byte fixtures, environment capture, shader probe validation, keyboard black-box capture helpers, and screenshot launch helpers | Gives protocol work a quick regression floor before heavier Rust, Nix, or visual checks. | Can become the shared Rio/Ghostty/Kitty comparison harness for parity decisions and CI gates. | `nix run .#yazelix-protocol-conformance -- verify`; `list`; `emit`; `record-env`; `launch-cpu-screenshot`; `cargo check --manifest-path tools/yazelix_protocol_conformance/Cargo.toml` |

| runtime | Approved local-to-remote reads | Collects paths before approval, shows preview body, bounds path count/traversal depth, rejects symlink parents, lists regular file/directory metadata, streams one regular file at a time, and handles cancel/finish | A terminal app can request local files only after explicit approval and bounded path validation. | Could support safer local-to-remote project handoff flows from inside Yazelix. | `cargo fmt --check`; `rio-backend` `osc5113` and `kitty_file_transfer` tests; `cargo check -p rioterm`; `cargo build -p rioterm`; `nix run .#yazelix-protocol-conformance -- verify`; `git diff --check` |
| runtime | Zlib compression | Supports zlib compression for regular-file send and receive data | Large regular-file transfers can use the common compressed path instead of only raw bytes. | Creates room for more efficient artifact movement once broader transfer UX exists. | Focused file-transfer tests; `nix run .#yazelix-protocol-conformance -- verify` fixture `kitty_file_transfer_zlib_file` |
| runtime | Explicit advanced-feature rejections | Proves `pw`/shared-secret metadata does not bypass approval, symlink/hardlink file types are rejected without staged files, and rsync/delta transmission rejects before sessions/prompts | Unsupported dangerous features fail closed and are covered by tests. | Defines the exact acceptance bar before adding destination chooser, metadata, links, secrets, or rsync support. | `cargo fmt --check`; focused `osc5113` tests; `kitty_file_transfer` parser tests; `cargo check -p rioterm`; `nix run .#yazelix-protocol-conformance -- verify`; `git diff --check` |

Current policy rejections:

- destination chooser UX
- symlink and hardlink creation/traversal
- metadata preservation beyond bytes/path/kind/size
- generic shared-secret or password bypass
- rsync/delta transmission

## Benchmark Tooling

| Kind | Surface | Fork-owned addition | Practical implication today | Future possibility | Verification evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tooling | Frame-time harness | Adds env-gated Rio frame JSONL logging, stdlib frame benchmark runner/summarizer, `/proc` CPU/RSS sampling, and built-in scroll/idle/Kitty graphics/Sixel/shader workloads | Makes performance claims about scrolling, image workloads, and shaders measurable from local artifacts. | Can become a repeatable regression gate for Ghostty comparisons and renderer changes. | `nix develop -c cargo fmt --check`; `nix develop -c cargo check -p rioterm`; `nix develop -c cargo build -p rioterm`; `python3 -m py_compile tools/yazelix_benchmark.py`; `python3 tools/yazelix_benchmark.py self-test`; real frame-run smoke under `nix develop`; `nix run .#yazelix-protocol-conformance -- verify`; `git diff --check` |

## Document Boundary

- This file is the fork-owned addition ledger
- `docs/yazelix/validated_not_added.md` is the validation-only ledger for
  inherited behavior, baseline probes, benchmark results, source audits,
  parser-only evidence, and deferred runtime support
- Deferred/frontier protocol detail belongs in
  `docs/yazelix/validated_not_added.md` or
  `docs/yazelix/frontier_kitty_protocols.md`, not in this file
